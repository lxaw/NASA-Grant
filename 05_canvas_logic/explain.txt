Let's add some logic to make the canvas an actual drawing board. 
We'll do this using JavaScript event listeners.
We can also get rid of our "Click me!" button. We don't need it anymore.

index.html
- get rid of "Click me!" button

index.js
- Remove old code for "Click me!" button.
- We start by finding the canvas element from the webpage
- Then, we dynamically set the size of the canvas based on the size of the window
- Then we add event listeners to handle drawing
-- mousemove: Track movement of mouse. We want to draw wherever the mouse goes over when the user is clicking down
-- mousedown: When the user clicks, begin drawing
-- mouseup: When the user let's go, stop drawing
