Let's start adding some more elements to our website.

index.html
- In the head, we link to the stylesheet we created earlier
- We move our "Hello World" text to a paragraph element
- Now, we add another element to our homepage
-- This "canvas" element is an area on the page that will be used to draw on later


styles.css
- Add some style to the "canvas" element. Add a border.
