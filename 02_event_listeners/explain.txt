In order to make things happen on the website, we need to respond to user actions (like clicks).
We do this by adding "Event Listeners" using JavaScript

index.html
- First, we create a "button" element on our homepage. 
-- We give this button a name (id) and some text to display.
- We can add JavaScript code to the page using a <Script> tag
-- We create a function called "whatToDoOnClick" that shows an alert on the page.
-- We find the button element we created using the id we gave it earlier
-- We add an event listener to listen for whenever the user clicks this button. This calls the function we made earlier.
