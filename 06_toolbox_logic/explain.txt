Let's add some more logic. This time to let the user's input actually change what's happening
We'll do this using JavaScript event listeners again

index.js
- We first add an event listener to trigger if the user click the clear button. This will clear the canvas
- We add event listeners for the two fields we added earlier. If the user changes either value, we update the variable in javascript
