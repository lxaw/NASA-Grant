To let users interact with our website, they need to be able to change some settings (color of drawing, width of strokes)
We do this by adding some "input" elements to our homepage.
"label" elements are used to display text to user telling them what the input is for.
We also move the JavaScript code from last module to its own file (for organization), and source it.

Note: We are not doing anything with these inputs yet, we need to handle inputs using JavaScript. Right now, these input do nothing.

index.html 
- Add a "div" element to hold our inputs. This is used for organization and styling.
-- Add a "h1" element. This is a header.
-- Add two "input" elements. One will let the user enter a number. The other lets them choose a color.
-- Add two "label" elements. These just add text to the webpage.
-- Add a button. This will be used to clear the canvas later.
- Source our JavaScript code using a "script" tag

index.js
- This file will hold all of our JavaScript code.
- By sourcing this file in index.html, it will work the same as before.
