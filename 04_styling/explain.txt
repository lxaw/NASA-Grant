Let's make our homepage look prettier. Let's move the user inputs the left of the screen in a sidebar.
We will do this using CSS in styles.css


styles.css
- modify our main "body" element to take up the whole space of our window
- Use display flex to align our user inputs as a column on the left
- Change color, fontsize, etc. of user input sidebar
- Move canvas into a div for organization
